# Summary of Decisions

- Prioritizing software development best practices by verifying functionality of each function with convering test cases
- Focusing on creating a running app for further discussion:
  - What functionality can be added to app?
  - What are known issues with the app?
- Focusing on limiting scope of GenAI agent to prevent bloat and slop with controlled prompts
- Decided to move audio files to root directory to prevent path issues with bundle

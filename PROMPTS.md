load @SPEC.md into context

based on the info from @SPEC.md, create an architecture document called "ARCH.md" that will explain the details of implementation for the app. IMPORTANT, focus on simplicity over complexity.

As described in @SPEC.md, record my input in @PROMPTS.md. Now, following @ARCH.md, lets incrementally write the app.

Our development loop will be as follows:
1. You implement a feature with its views and functions
2. You write tests for the functions
3. I will review the code you wrote
4. After my approval, you will commit the changes to git
